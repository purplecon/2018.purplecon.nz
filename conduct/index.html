        <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
        <p>
        The organisers would vastly prefer purplecon to be a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, or religion. As such, we do not tolerate harassment in any form, even if you think it's funny. Attendees violating these rules will be respectfully called out, slam jammed into the shadow realm, or even expelled from the event at the organisers' discretion, whim, or otherwise arbitrary decision.
        </p>

        <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. You'd hope this would be a comprehensive list but the organisers have faith in the inventive genius of random bozos.
        </p>

    <p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up and including ejecting you from the rest of the 'con and pre-emptively banning you from future events. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately. You can do this at us@purplecon.nz, or of course in person.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note, while we take all concerns raised seriously, we will use our discretion (such as it is) as to in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents and may decline to take any further action. All concerns will be recorded.
    </p>

    <p>
    Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue/event security or local law enforcement, locate your posse, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference up to and including talking about anime at incredible length.
    </p>

    <p>
    We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference events.
    </p>
