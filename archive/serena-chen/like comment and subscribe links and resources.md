For a very nice read about behaviour change on a large scale, I can recommend "Changeology: how to enable groups, communities, and societies to do things they've never done before" by Les Robinson (Scribe Publications, 2013). Unfortunately this is a Real Book that you'll have to either buy or acquire through a friend.
