what do you think of when you hear "hacker"?

_who_ do you think of?

 here's what everyone else thinks, based on what you get by google image searching "hacker"

but what if you don't look like that? or if you don't want to be like that? you can, of course, be your own person. you can act different to everyone else. but you'll be a lot more alone.

it's nice when people are like you, because they understand you. so if you're not into looking and acting like a hacker, you'll be different to everyone else.


is there a particularly good reason for that? does being tough, into heavy metal, or otherwise wearing exclusively black make you better at hacking?

or is it.... that wearing a hoodue, being tough, and caring more about your skills than other people is an easy option if you're alone?



## will there be another purplecon?
